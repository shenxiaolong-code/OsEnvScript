# WinScript
Productivity tools : windows batch script programming support lib, used in my automatization tools/jobs.

# purpose
- This library is used in my regular work automatization:  
  right-click menu to run the general daily tasks.  
  One-clicking to collect all necessary information on our customer side without complex instructions.

- similar with many advanced programming languages  
  this library provides features by function with input/output parameters, it always is code-reused.  
  structure relation : module(s) -> function(s)/object(s) -> input parmeter(s) -> output parameter(s) + return code.

2.3  print the source file path, source line number, and error source code automatically in color text when an error occurs.
